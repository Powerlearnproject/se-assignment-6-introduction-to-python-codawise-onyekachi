3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

   Answer:
   greet = "Hello, World!"
   print(greet)

   *Syntax:
   -greet is a variable to hold the sting "Hello, World!"
   -print is a Python function to display result.


4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

   Answer:
    - Data Types:
    1. Integer (int): Represents whole numbers (positive, negative, or zero) with no decimal points. Examples: 10, -5, 0.
    2. Float: Represents real numbers with a decimal point. Examples: 3.14, -2.5, 10.0.
    3. String (str) : Represents a sequence of characters, including letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces. Enclosed in single or double  quotes. Examples: "Hello, World!", 'This is a string'.
    4. List (list) : An ordered collection of items that can be of different data types. Enclosed in square brackets []. Elements can be accessed by index. Examples: [1, "apple", 3.14], ["red", "green", "blue"]
    5. Tuple (tuple): An ordered collection of items similar to lists, but immutable (cannot be changed after creation). Enclosed in parentheses (). Examples: ("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday").
    6. Dictionary (dict): Is a collection of key-value pairs. Keys are unique and immutable (often strings). Values can be of any data type. Enclosed in curly braces {}. Used to store and access data by associating unique keys with corresponding values. Example: person = {"name": "Bob", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}

    *Script to demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
      - # Integer
      x = 5   

      - # Float
      y = 3.14    

      - # String    
      name = "Alice" 

      -  # Boolean 
      is_valid = True

      - # List
      fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

      - # Tuple 
      point = (10, 20)   

      - # Dictionary
      person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}





5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.


   Answer:

   Conditional statements and loops are useed for control flow structures in Python that dictate how your program executes based on certain conditions or repeated actions.

   - Conditional Statements: Allow your program to make decisions based on whether a condition is True or False.

   - Loops: Used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met.

   *Examples of an `if-else` statement:

   age = 18

   if age >= 18:
      print("You are an adult.")
   elif age > 12:
      print("You are a teenager.")
   else:
      print("You are a child.")

   *Examples of an `for` loop:

   for i in range(5):
    print(f"i is {i}")







6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.


   Answer:

   Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They are essential for building well-organized, modular, and maintainable. A function definition typically starts with the def keyword followed by the function name and parentheses.

   *Why are Functions Useful?

   1. Code Reusability: By defining a function for a specific task, you can avoid writing the same code repeatedly throughout your program.This reduces redundancy and makes your code more concise.

   2. Modularity: Functions break down your program into smaller, self-contained units. This improves code readability and maintainability.

   3. Improved Maintainability:If you need to modify a specific functionality, you only need to change the code within the relevant function. This makes debugging and updating code easier.

   4. Promoting Readability: Descriptive function names can clearly communicate the purpose of the code block. This enhances code understanding for both you and other programmers.


def add(a, b):
   return a + b

print(add(5, 3))



7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.


Answer:

Lists:
- Ordered Collection: Elements are stored in a specific sequence and accessed by their index (starting from 0).
- Duplicates Allowed: Lists can contain duplicate elements.

Dictionaries:
- Unordered Collection: Elements are not stored in a specific order and are accessed by unique keys.
- Unique Keys: Keys must be unique and immutable (often strings or numbers). Values can be of any data type, and can be duplicated, but not keys.


 - # List of Numbers
      fruits = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

 - # Dictionary
      person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "Abuja"}



- # List example (ordered sequence of fruits)
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[1])  # Output: "banana" (access by index)

- # Dictionary example (storing user information)
user = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
print(user["name"])  # Output: "Alice" (access by key)


8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.


   Answer:

   Exception handling in Python is a mechanism for managing errors (exceptions) that may occur during program execution. It is a written cod that allows you to handle unexpected situations and prevent program crashes.

   Essential components os Exception Handling are try, except, and finally

   - try block: This block contains the code that might potentially raise an exception.
   - except block: This block defines how to handle a specific type of exception that might be raised within the try block. You can have multiple except blocks to handle different exception types.
   - finally block (optional): This block contains code that will always be executed, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It's commonly used to release resources or perform cleanup tasks.


def divide(numerator, denominator):
  """Divides two numbers and handles potential ZeroDivisionError."""
  try:
    result = numerator / denominator
  except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Cannot divide by zero.")
  finally:
    print("Division operation completed.")  # Always executes

# Example usage
divide(10, 2)  # Output: 5, Division operation completed.
divide(10, 0)  # Output: Error: Cannot divide by zero., Division operation completed.




9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.


   Answer:

   - Modules: A module is a single Python file (.py file) that contains Python code. This code can include functions, classes, variables, and runnable code. 
   Modules help to logically organize your Python code by grouping related code into a single file. This makes the code easier to manage and reuse.

   - Packages: A package is a collection of modules organized in directories that include a special __init__.py file. This file can be empty or contain initialization code for the package.
   Packages allow you to organize your module files into a directory hierarchy, which helps to manage a large codebase with related functionalities grouped together.

   Im summary, Modules are single Python files that contain code. While Packages are directories containing multiple modules, identified by the presence of __init__.py.


   *Importing and Using a Module:
   You can import a module into your Python script using the import statement.

   *Example Using the math Module:
   The math module is a standard Python module that provides mathematical functions and constants.

   - # Import the math module
   import math

   - # Using functions from the math module
   number = 9
   square_root = math.sqrt(number)
   print(f"The square root of {number} is {square_root}")

   - # Using constants from the math module
   pi_value = math.pi
   print(f"The value of pi is {pi_value}")

   - # Using other functions from the math module
   angle = math.radians(45)  # Convert 45 degrees to radians
   sine_value = math.sin(angle)
   print(f"The sine of 45 degrees is {sine_value}")
   

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.


    Answer:

   *Reading From Files:
   Use methods like read(), readline(), or readlines() depending on your needs:
   read(): Reads the entire file content as a string.
   readline(): Reads a single line from the file as a string. You can call it repeatedly to read all lines.
   readlines(): Reads all lines from the file as a list of strings.


   *Writing to Files:
   Use the write() method to write content to the file. OR

   Use the open() function with the filename and access mode ('w' for writing or 'a' for appending).
   Using 'w' mode will overwrite existing content, while 'a' will add new content at the end.
   

   *Script that reads the content of a file:

   # Open the file in read mode
   with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
      # Read the entire content of the file
      content = file.read()

   # Print the content to the console
   print(content)


   *Script that writes a list of strings to a file:

   # List of strings to write to the file
   lines = [
      "Line 1: This is the first line.\n",
      "Line 2: This is the second line.\n",
      "Line 3: This is the third line.\n"
   ]

   # Open the file in write mode
   with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
      # Write each string in the list to the file
      file.writelines(lines)
